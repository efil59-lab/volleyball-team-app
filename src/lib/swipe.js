// Copied from mytv/src/swipe.js (the GoalTime carousel Efi approved on his phone,
// 5.10.26) — keep the two in step; fixes belong in both.
//
// Carousel-style paging between the bottom tabs, with the feel of a phone
// home screen. The first version only *hinted* at a swipe (dragged the pane
// 90px at 0.4 damping, snapped it back, then hard-swapped the content), which
// is why it felt wrong.
//
// What a real home screen does, and what this does:
//   1. BOTH screens are on-screen during the drag — the outgoing one leaves
//      while the incoming one arrives, edge to edge.
//   2. The content tracks the finger 1:1. No damping, except past the ends.
//   3. On release the motion COMPLETES (the incoming screen slides fully in)
//      instead of snapping back and cutting.
//   4. A quick flick commits even when short — velocity counts, not only
//      distance.
//
// RTL geometry: the next tab sits physically to the LEFT of the current one
// (בית is the rightmost tab), so dragging the finger RIGHT pulls it into view.
// That keeps "finger right = next screen" while the content still moves WITH
// the finger — which is the half that makes it feel native.
//
// The rules below that look over-careful were all paid for on a real phone, in
// Engivo, which runs the same gesture. Each is a bug that reached a user, and
// almost every one arrived as the same sentence: "the first swipe does
// nothing, the second one works."

export const LOCK_SLOP = 12;         // px before the gesture commits to a direction
// ...and the distance after which it MUST commit to one, so that a drag held
// near the diagonal cannot sit undecided for its whole life. Deliberately well
// past a first sample: tried at 36px, it swallowed the very arc that the equal
// margins below exist to protect.

// swipe instead of three — and the bottom bar is always on screen to say where
// you actually are, so the ring can never leave anyone lost.
//
// The answer can still be "nowhere", and that is why this is a function of its
// own: on a screen that is not in the strip at all (search, item, admin), a
// committed swipe has no destination, and the pane it moved has to be put back
// or the app sits there shifted sideways with the bar still marking the tab you
